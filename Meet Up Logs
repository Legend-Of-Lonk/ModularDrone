Write in format: Date - What we did

6/10 - Initial planning at the library. Started material list and created on OnShape Files: CAD/prototypeI.stl

6/20 - Changed project idea, met up at the library again. Switched from search and rescue drone focus to a modular drone focus. Created new model through OnShape Files: CAD/Prototype II.stl

6/27 - Additions added to drone. Designed trays designed to hold components in place with bolts. Designed longer arms in order to compensate for increasing area. Added motor mounts for both arm designs, goal to allow any motor to be used.

7/4 - Supply run. Collected almost all the screws necessary. Missing a couple screws and bolts needed and the ones required for the motors.

TBD-TBD

8/2 - Created temporary drone body. Top plate (xbrace) was warping a lot so we changed the design later on.

8/9 - Assembled new prototype main body. Main goal was to test the fit of screws and assembly. Designed new support beams for Nano plate and X-brace with OnShape Files: CAD/Prototype III
